# SEASPrint #
This app prints office documents from an android phone directly to a printer in SEAS. It requires your SEAS password for login, but it doesn't need any special administrative rights on either the phone or the SEAS network. With this app, you can print an office document directly from your phone in ~3 clicks. Supported formats include PDF, `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.doc`, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Developed during [PennApps 2010](http://pennapps.com/2010/#2).
